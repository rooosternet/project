				<p>Roooster is a service for creative leaders, who run team based projects. Roooster is aiming to solve the problem of wasting too much time, effort and money, looking for top creative talents, at the expense of the actual work. </p>
				<p>The problem of availability is a grave from many projects: You want the best people for the project, but the best are almost always taken. Finding, evaluating and adding the best available team members, is every creative leader’s living nightmare; It is a tedious and time consuming process that has to be done over and over… and over again. We are all used to having workdays gone down the drain, browsing through hundreds of online portfolios and websites with rating systems that are hard to trust.</p>
				<p>Roooster is the brainchild of two industry veterans, who came up with the idea of an open community of collaborators. Our vision is to cerate agile and flexible businesses in the creative sphere, without the need for time-consuming managerial tasks and unwarranted overheads.</p>
				<p>In the future, we will offer many tools to help achieve this vision. Right now, our new platform focuses on the main ingredient of the creative collaboration: great team communication.
